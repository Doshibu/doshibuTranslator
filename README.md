WebExtension To quickly Translate a given sentence.

##  :open_mouth: To use it  :ok_hand:
Open the Add-On manager (accessible on firefox at the url "about:debugging") and click on a button like "Load a temporary module".
It will open a file uploader, then you will just have to submit the manifest.json.

The manifest.json file is a JSON-formatted file, and it is the only file required for a WebExtension.
